              Overview of the data set
          </h2>
          <p>
              I chose the Vancouver Canada region as my dataset because I have spent most of my life here.
              The OpenStreetMap xml file of Vancouver is 70.5 MB in size.
          </p>
          <p>
              There were hundreds of contributors. The most prominent contributors, their number of contributions, and the percent
              of contributions they made are shown in the chart below:
          </p>
          <p><svg class="user-chart"></svg></p>
          <p>
              <svg class="elem-chart"></svg>
              The xml elements that had to be parsed from the dataset were nodes, ways, relations, tags, members and nd's. These
              were present in the following proportion:
              <ul>
                <li class="node">nodes : 319347</li>
                <li class="nd">nd's : 397853</li>
                <li class="tag">tags: 118598</li>
                <li class="way">ways: 51319</li>
                <li class="member">members: 5066</li>
                <li class="relation">relations: 600</li>
              <div><i style="font-size: 10px">(Note: There are so few relations that they are not visible on the chart)</i></div>
              </ul>
              The top level elements were first transformed to json with a file size of 81.9 MB, and then inserted into
              a mongoDB instance. There were 371266 documents in total, each of which correspond to either a node, way or relation
              in the OSM data.

              > db.elements.aggregate({$group: {_id:"$elem_type", count:{$sum:1}}})

          <h2>
            Problems with the data
          </h2>
          <h3>Nested keys</h3>
          <p>
              An initial look at the 'tag' elements revealed that there were no problematic characters in the tag key ('k') attributes.
              However there were a significant number of tags with nested keys. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>'seamark:buoy_lateral:shape'</li>
                <li>'seamark:buoy_lateral:system'</li>
                <li>'seamark:buoy_special_purpose:colour'</li>
                <li>'seamark:information'</li>
                <li>'seamark:light:character'</li>
                <li>'seamark:light:colour'</li>
              </ul>
              These keys had to be handled elegantly to retain the key value pairs, as well as the relation to parent keys.
              The best solution was to create nested objects, for each of the nested keys. The above example would then become:<br>
              <pre>...{ seamark: { buoy_lateral: {shape: value,
...                            system: value},
...             buoy_special_purpose: {colour: value},
...             information: value,
...             light: {character: value,
...                     colour: value}
...}</pre><p>
          <h3>
          Inconsistent capitalization of values
          </h3>
          <p>
          For simplicity and consistency the keys were modified such that all dashes were replaced with an underscore,
          and all upper case letters were replaced with lower case letters. The tag values were also modified so that
          they were represented in lower case form. I did this because the initial data set had both 'Christian' and 'christian'
          as religious orientations, when these should clearly be the same.
          </p>
          <h3>
              Over abbreviated street names and inconsistent postal code representation
          </h3>
          <p>
              Among the address field, I modified the street names that used abbreviations to use the full word instead. Some
              streets had the word Vancouver in the street name which is redundant.<br>In Canada,
              postal codes are represented by a 6 character alphanumeric string, sometimes with a space separating the first 3 from
              the last 3. For consistency I removed the space from the postal codes that had one. The following query demonstrates
              the different representations of postal codes, as well as an incorrect code (v6hh 2r5). The incorrect ones can be
              improved by checking for consecutive letters or numbers and removing one of the two. (The post code alternates between letters
              and numbers.)

          {"_id": "v6h2r2"}
          {"_id": "v6hh 2r5"}
          {"_id": "v5z1n3"}
              </pre>
